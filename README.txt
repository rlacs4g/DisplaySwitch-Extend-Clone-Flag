Simple batch command that uses Displayswitch.exe to switch between a clone and extend. 

For my case, I am using multiple (2) monitors. I use this batch command to switch between clone and extend when I want to use the primary monitor for another output/sourc (IE: Gaming)

A flag is used to switch between the two using an IF ELSE statement.
